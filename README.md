<h1> BattleShip Game </h1> <h3><a href= "https://battleship-gold.vercel.app/">[ battleship-r47mwp235-arath089s-projects.vercel.app](https://battleship-gold.vercel.app/)</a></h3>
<h3> A simple <em>JavaScript</em> based game which will ask you to make guesses and find Ships on the radar system.</h3>
<h3> Rules of the game are as follows- </h3>
<p>
- There are a total of 9 ships located somewhere in this grid in groups of 3. The groups can be either horizontal or vertical in direction. Not diagnol.
</p>
<p>
- Enter your guesses in the box and press "Fire" or press Enter.
</p>
<p>
- Your job is to find the locations of these ships in the grid with minimum guesses.
</p>
<p>
- Remember, the ships are in a group of 3. So, if you spot one ship, the rest 2 ships are going to be neighbours of the spotted ship.
</p>
<p>
- When you find all the 3 fleets of ships, you will win the game. The game will display the stats about your performance based on the number of guesses.
